# What is BeeHive?
BeeHive is an IoT platform designed to deliver on-the-cloud solutions for IoT applications. It offers a unified API built on robust up-to-date technologies and techniques, targeted to all kinds of end-users looking to implement IoT and makers looking to market their products to end-users.

# The Universal IoT Platform

The ultimate goal of BeeHive is to become the universal IoT platform for all IoT applications by:

1. Offering a robust and easy-to-implement API
2. Offering comprehensive services for use in IoT applications
3. Ensuring secure encrypted communication
4. Being hosted completely on-the-cloud

## For the End-User

Save time and resources in setting up your own IoT platform with endless configurations and development. BeeHive offers ready-made services* built specifically to run out-of-the-box:

1. Thing Management Platform
2. Automation Engine
3. Data Collection and Analytics
4. Ready-to-use MQTT broker
5. Web Application GUI for Thing Management

All services run on-the-cloud, eliminating the need for local infrastructure. BeeHive's unified API focuses on simplicity and intuitiveness for easy end-user adoption and use of the listed services.

*\*services listed are not final, more may be added in the future*

## For the Maker

BeeHive aims to simplify the development process for makers by offering maker-centered services* targeted on development, set-up and use, and post-production stages of a device's lifecycle:

BeeHive allows for makers to quickly develop devices on a unified easy-to-use API for a wide range of applicationsâ€”from smarthomes to smart cities. For makers looking for a wider customer reach, BeeHive also offers platform integration** with other IoT ecosystems (eg. Google, Amazon) without the hassle of adopting the individual APIs.

BeeHive also offers post-production support by hosting OTA updates, allowing makers to eliminate dedicated infrastructure and host their aftermarket support completely on BeeHive.

# We Need Your Help!

**At its current state, BeeHive only offers the very basic services it aims to deliver. With support and funding, BeeHive can be spun into a startup and expand its services to reach its goal and become the universal IoT platform.**
