# What is BeeHive?
BeeHive is an IoT platform designed to deliver on-the-cloud solutions centered on delivering IoT devices (or *Things*) to a wide market of end-users. As an IoT platform, it aims to bridge the gap between device makers and their end-users by providing a unified API which offers a vast amount of services, allowing for increased market presence without the overhead costs of IoT platform development.



# Who Benefits from BeeHive?
## What's the Problem?
Currently, the IoT industry is a melting pot of a multitude of technologies. The smart scene which includes but not limited to smart home, smart city, smart grid, and smart farming, are different sides of the same polygon. While their applications are in very different fields, the underlying concept is just the same: connect multiple devices together to perform specific tasks. This simple concept does not have a simple solution, however. These branches of the smart scene are offered with various solutions with differing levels of complexity. Smart home is dominated by Google, Apple, and Amazon with their respective smart home IoT platforms which are, to an extent, easy to consume by both device makers and end-users. The other smart scene branches do not have the luxury of ready-made IoT platforms that will readily suit their needs. Usually, institutions looking to smartify hire dedicated development teams to build the hardware, software, and infrastructure needed. This is a resource-intensive endeavor which discourages most institutions from availing IoT solutions.
## End-user Hindrances to Implementing IoT
### Development
IoT systems encompass both software and hardware development. The primary architecture for IoT systems makes use of an IoT platform. An IoT platform is a multi-layer technology that enables straightforward provisioning, management, and automation of connected devices.

At the lowest level of this architecture are IoT-capable devices of low-power, low-cost microcontrollers that connect over a network. These devices are then programmed to communicate with the IoT platform that will manage the device. At the highest level is the IoT platform itself, which on its own needs tremendous amounts of planning, development, and maintenance. Developing every level of an IoT system technology stack is resource-intensive and time-consuming, which overshadows its perceived benefits.

*Ideally, the IoT device manufacturer should only focus on manufacturing devices, and the end-user should only focus on procuring and configuring these devices for their use.*

### Infrastructure

IoT systems are, in essence, a network of computers that communicate with each other. Such networks require comprehensive infrastructures that will require minimal downtime and high availability. Establishing such infrastructures entails massive investment in manpower and computer resources, if it is decided to be established in-house.

With development and infrastructure in mind, great investment and commitment is needed in developing and maintaining IoT systems. This effectively prohibits even medium-sized enterprises from implementing IoT applications to their business.

### Vendor Lock-in

Because of the aforementioned hindrances, institutions looking to implement IoT turn to vendors that offer various components in across the IoT system technology stack. These vendors often supply the software and infrastructure necessary for establishing IoT systems, usually through Software-as-a-Service business models.

The problem with this is that vendors often implement their own API and only offer specific services for very specific areas of IoT. In the case of the smarthome industry, the big vendors like Google, Amazon, and Apple all offer their own unique APIs and serve only to their portions of the IoT-consuming population. Adapting even just one API takes a considerable amount of commitment and investment to the vendor. This results to a vendor lock-in where smarthome device manufacturers are tied to the services of the vendor whose API they choose to implement.

Smarthome device manufacturers circumvent this problem by implementing other vendor APIs for increasing their reach. This solution can become problematic as more APIs are implemented due to the fact that bigger development teams are needed to do the implementation. This effectively negates the benefits of subscribing to a vendor in the first place.

## Development Hindrances for Makers

### API Hell

There are many IoT platforms with their own unique APIs which cater to very specific areas of the market. 

## BeeHive as a Universal IoT Platfrom

The hindrances call for an IoT platform with one API that can offer the services needed by IoT companies across the industry, encompassing many applications such as home automation, smart farming, production line streamlining, and more. 

The goal of BeeHive is to alleviate the software and infrastructure burdens of implementing IoT by offering a unified API for ready-to-use services on-the-cloud. This fosters development, particularly for devices that can be made to utilize BeeHive's API and be used for a variety of purposes. Effectively, the adoption of a unified API will allow device makers to focus more on making devices over endless development for multiple APIs for specific markets and uses. This broadens the reach of device makers and closes the gap between them and the market.

For the end-users, BeeHive serves as the IoT platform which orchestrates their devices. In the ideal world, the end-user must only think about procuring devices and configuring them to work towards a specific goal without worrying about the underlying platform. 

# How Does it Work?

BeeHive caters to both makers and end-users. Makers make devices that will run on BeeHive and end-users subscribe to BeeHive to use the devices.

Under a unified API, device makers can develp devices that reach a wide market of applications. BeeHive allows for makers to focus only on developing devices which the end-users will use for their own IoT applications. This alleviates the burden for makers on which markets they need to target and which APIs they need to adopt in order to reach those target markets. Under a unified API, the entire market will be open to them.

This freedom trickles down to the end-users who will benefit from the surge of general-purpose devices manufactured by the makers. The end-users will have access to a wider range of devices AND the IoT platform that will run these devices, without much hassle for development.

With these, BeeHive will cultivate the relationship between makers and end-users, allowing for a boom in the IoT industry.
